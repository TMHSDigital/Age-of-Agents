## The Big Three Frameworks
*The cognitive architectures for autonomous systems.*

| Framework | Core Philosophy | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LangGraph** | The industry standard for building stateful, cyclic agent workflows with fine-grained control and persistence. | [GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) |
| **Microsoft AutoGen** | Robust framework for conversational multi-agent collaboration where agents communicate like a team. | [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) |
| **CrewAI** | High-level framework for orchestrating role-based AI "crews" with defined backstories and goals. | [GitHub](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI) |

### Emerging "Code-First" Standard
*   **PydanticAI**
    A lightweight, Python-native framework utilizing strict type validation to ensure agentic outputs are reliable and production-ready.

# Age-of-Agents

## Mission
A curated directory of the "Gold Standard" AI agent frameworks, infrastructure, and tools. 
**Philosophy:** Less is More. No noise, only the industry-leading, actively maintained projects defining the agentic era.

## The Big Three Frameworks
*The cognitive architectures for autonomous systems.*

**LangGraph**  
The industry standard for building stateful, cyclic agent workflows with fine-grained control and persistence.  
[Source Code](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph)

**Microsoft AutoGen**  
A robust framework for conversational multi-agent collaboration and event-driven workflows where agents communicate like a team.  
[Source Code](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen)

**CrewAI**  
A high-level framework for orchestrating role-based AI "crews" with defined backstories, goals, and hierarchical processes.  
[Source Code](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI)

## Essential Infrastructure
*The sensory organs and hands for autonomous agents.*

### Search & Browsing
**Tavily**  
Search API specifically built for agents, delivering clean, LLM-ready context instead of raw links to reduce hallucination.  
[Website](https://tavily.com)

**Browserbase**  
Headless browser infrastructure with stealth mode and session debugging, enabling agents to interact with dynamic web apps at scale.  
[Website](https://www.browserbase.com)

### Execution & Protocols
**E2B**  
Secure, ephemeral cloud sandboxes that give agents "computational literacy" (code interpretation) without risking host infrastructure.  
[Website](https://e2b.dev)

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)**  
The open standard for connecting AI models to external tools, data sources, and resources through a unified interface.  
[Website](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)

## Discovery Platforms
*Where to find, host, and distribute agents.*

**Hugging Face Agents**  
The open-source hub for community-driven agents, reusable components, and standardized benchmarking environments.  
[Website](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/agents)

**OpenAI GPT Store**  
The premier consumer-facing marketplace for specialized GPTs and managed agent runtimes within the OpenAI ecosystem.
